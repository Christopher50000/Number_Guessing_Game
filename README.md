# Number_Guessing_Game
A beginner python project that I created to learn more about the python coding language. The programming project is a number guessing game. The user inputs their name then prompts the user if they are ready to play the game. Then user inputs two integers they want to guess between. Then by using the randint() function the program creates a random integer between the user's integer inputs. Then the user inputs their guessing integer and If the user guesses wrong a hint will then be provided stating to guess higher or lower. When the user guesses correctly the program will then output the usersname along with the number of attempts the user guessed before guessing correctly.  1
